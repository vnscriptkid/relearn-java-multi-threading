- why not putting `synchronized` to all methods of class?
- ways to make a section critical section?
- atomic ops:

- pros of using `volatile` over `synchronized`?
  - do not prevent threads from executing concurrently
- race condition:
  - what is it?
  - when it happens?
  - how to fix?
- data race:
  - what is it?
  - how it is different from race condition?
  - why it happens?
  - when it happens? when it not happens?
  - ways to fix?
  - data race without race condition?
