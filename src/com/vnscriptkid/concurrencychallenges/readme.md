## sync
- why not putting `synchronized` to all methods of class?
- ways to make a section critical section?
- atomic ops:
  - ref assignments
  - assignments to primitive types except long, double (int, short, byte, float, char, boolean)
  - assignments to long, double (with `volatile`)
- pros of using `volatile` over `synchronized`?
  - do not prevent threads from executing concurrently
- race condition:
  - what is it?
  - when it happens?
  - how to fix?
- data race:
  - what is it?
  - how it is different from race condition?
  - why it happens?
  - when it happens? when it not happens?
  - ways to fix?
  - data race without race condition? 
- locking choices:
  - fine-grained: separate locks for different resources
    - potential issue: deadlock
    - pros, cons?
  - coarse-grained: one lock for different resources
    - pros, cons?

- 4 conditions of deadlock?
- Outstanding solution to deadlock? lock resources in the same order 
- Other solutions?
  - watchdog
  - thread interruption ([x] synchronized)
  - tryLock ([x] synchronized)
